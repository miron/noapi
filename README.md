Scheduled Github Action which checks every 30 minutes the top 68 BPs on EOS for Homepage  as returned by get_producers, appends bp.json to site and extracts api_endpoint.  ToDo: catch parse errors, check site for other locations than main path for bp.json,  set timeout, check for payment so that BPs are not at fixed 68 value.
