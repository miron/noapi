Scheduled Github Action checking every hour top 68 BPs on EOS for homepage   as returned by get_producers, appending and extracting api_endpoints.    ToDo:   - check sites for other locations than main path for bp.json   - check for payment so that BPs are not at fixed 68 value   - rotate used api for curl
